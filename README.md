[Leakage in Regional Environmental Policy: The Case of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Maniloff/publication/311536444_Leakage_in_Regional_Environmental_Policy_The_Case_of_the_Regional_Greenhouse_Gas_Initiative/links/584b065008aeb989251de6c0/Leakage-in-Regional-Environmental-Policy-The-Case-of-the-Regional-Greenhouse-Gas-Initiative.pdf)
Abstract: Subglobal and subnational greenhouse gas policies are often thought to be less effective than comprehensive policies as production and emissions of trade exposed industries may move from the regulated to the unregulated regions. This so-called leakage may negate all emission reductions from the regulated regions and, even worse, may lead to an overall increase in emissions if the unregulated regions has equally or more emissions intensive production. We use detailed electricity generation and transmission data to show that this is the case for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a CO2 cap-and-trade program for the electricity sector in select Northeastern U.S. states. More specifically, our results indicate that RGGI induced a reduction in coal-fired generation in RGGI states and an increase in generation in RGGI-surrounding regions. This finding suggests that the pollution haven hypothesis holds for state-level variation in environmental policy, even when compliance costs are low. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that one-quarter of apparent emissions reductions actually leaked.

[Local Solutions to Global Problems: Climate Change Policies and Regulatory Jurisdiction](https://academic.oup.com/reep/article/2/2/175/1572474)
Abstract: "This article considers the efficacy of various types of environmental regulations when they are applied locally to pollutants, such as greenhouse gases, whose damages extend beyond the jurisdiction of the local regulator. While previous work has noted the possibility for leakage, whereby polluting sources move outside the jurisdiction of the regulation, we identify an additional problem that occurs when policies are targeted downstream, at consumers of goods whose production creates pollution. Specifically, we show how consumer-based policies can be circumvented by a simple reshuffling of who is buying from whom. We argue that the leakage problems are more pronounced with regulations that impose costs on firms than with subsidies that reward production of low-polluting goods. Reshuffling problems are more pronounced when the options for compliance are more flexible, such as with market-based regulations. We conclude that localities may be able to have the greatest impact on global pollutants when they enact relatively inflexible regulations such as efficiency standards or targeted subsidies."

## Organizations

### [C40 Cities](https://www.c40.org/)
"Around the world, C40 Cities connects 94 of the world’s greatest cities to take bold climate action, leading the way towards a healthier and more sustainable future. Representing 700+ million citizens and one quarter of the global economy, mayors of the C40 cities are committed to delivering on the most ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement at the local level, as well as to cleaning the air we breathe."

### [America's Pledge](https://www.americaspledgeonclimate.com/)

"In the wake of the Trump Administration’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement, an unprecedented number of U.S. cities, states, businesses, and universities have reaffirmed their commitment to helping America reach its Paris climate goals.

Whether through declarations like We Are Still In or new pledges and commitments of their own, these non-national actors are maintaining U.S. momentum on climate action in the absence of federal leadership. In July 2017, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown launched the America’s Pledge initiative, which will aggregate and quantify the actions of states, cities and businesses and other non-national actors in the United States to drive down their greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement."

### [We are Still In](https://www.wearestillin.com)
"Mayors, governors, and business leaders first began signing the We Are Still In declaration in June 2017 as a promise to world leaders that Americans would not retreat from the global pact to reduce emissions and stem the causes of climate change. The bipartisan coalition has since doubled in size, expanding to include over 3,500 representatives from all 50 states, spanning large and small businesses, mayors and governors, university presidents, faith leaders, tribal leaders, and cultural institutions.

We Are Still In signatories represent a constituency of more than half of all Americans, and taken together, they represent $6.2 trillion, a bigger economy than any nation other than the U.S. or China."

### [National Caucus of Environmental Legislators (NCEL)](https://www.ncel.net/)

"The National Caucus of Environmental Legislators empowers a nonpartisan network of legislative champions to protect, conserve, and improve the natural and human environment.

We believe that the key to advancing sound policy in the states is well-informed legislatures with strong champions who can advocate on behalf of the environment, develop shared strategies, and educate their colleagues about coalition building and opposition tactics.

NCEL does not lobby for the enactment or defeat of any state or federal legislation."

### [United States Climate Alliance](https://www.usclimatealliance.org/)
"U.S. Climate Alliance states are committed to taking real, on the ground action that urgently addresses the climate challenge. In becoming an Alliance member, states commit to:

* Implement policies that advance the goals of the Paris Agreement, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025

* Track and report progress to the global community in appropriate settings, including when the world convenes to take stock of the Paris Agreement, and

* Accelerate new and existing policies to reduce carbon pollution and promote clean energy deployment at the state and federal level."
